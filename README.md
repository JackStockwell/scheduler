# Day Sheduler

## Description

The motivation behind this project was to use 3rd Party APIs in my script such as jQuery and Day.js to simplify the process in creating a day scheduler which records previous input via local storage and uses DayJS to decide if something is past, present or future which dynamically changes the classes. This allows the scheduler real world use as not only does it save data locally, it also is date dependent meaning that on a new day it will not display yesterday's agenda; this allows you to organise your day better. 

I learned a lot about jQuery and API implementation. I have also learned how API implementation can help streamline processes and save you time as others have 'done the work for you' saving you from having to solve these problems yourself.
